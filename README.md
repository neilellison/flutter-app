# README

Very skeletal Twitter-like app. I followed a couple of tutorials but mostly googled how to create certain individual features. Here is the link to the main tutortial that I followed "https://codeburst.io/making-a-twitter-clone-in-raw-html-with-ruby-on-rails-and-a-lil-javascript-270a5e227cb2". This project was written mostly in ruby and HTML, with a little CSS for the fonts and colors of the text. You will not come across any errors in your localhost, but there are a few functionality issues with the like button.
